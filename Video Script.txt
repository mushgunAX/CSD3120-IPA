Good day. Today, I will show you how water is created from the reaction between two hydrogen molecules and one oxygen molecule.

As you can see, each molecule consists of two of its atoms, two hydrogen atoms form a hydrogen molecule, H2, and two oxygen atoms form an oxygen molecule, O2.

Why does hydrogen have one line between its atoms and oxygen have two lines between its atoms. This is because of how their outermost valence electrons form their covalent bonding. Each hydrogen atom only has one electron to share, so they form a single bond with that. Oxygen atoms have six valence electrons, and share two pairs of electrons to form the double bond seen in O2.

Why are there two hydrogen molecule but only one oxygen molecule. Remember that water molecules have two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in it, H2O. So that means that water is two parts hydgrogen and one part oxygen.

How do these three molecules form water molecules, then? Hydrogen gas H2 is highly flammable, so when it reacts with oxygen, it releases a lot of energy through an exothermic reaction, releasing a great deal of heat, light and sound as a result. Quite the violent reaction indeed, to make two molecules of water as a result.
